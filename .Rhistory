# Now I need to add a label to all of these studies to signify that they Were returned from the shopping search so that we can distinguish them from other studies when we later joined the datasets together:
Label <- rep("shopping", times = count(results_shopping2))
results_shopping_final <- results_shopping2 %>% bind_cols(Label) %>%
rename(Label = 14) %>%
print()
# View(results_shopping_final)
# Now save the cleaned results
write.csv(results_shopping_final, "Data extraction/shopping_data_cleaned.csv", row.names=FALSE)
# Number of publications per year:
shopping_hist<- hist(results_shopping2$Year,
xlim = c(1960,2023),
breaks = 10,
main = "Papers published per year on Shopping Addiction (PubMed)",
xlab = "Year")
